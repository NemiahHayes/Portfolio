# Creating an inlinehelper to ease the struggle of Box2D

The conversion between Box2D and the renderer is a process which occurs in every part of development, so it's quite useful to have an inline helper, or in this case my `inlineconverter`, to ease the process of converting between Box2D units and the pixels on the screen.

The core of this issue lies with Box2D using it's own measurements and coordinates for physics. It uses a simulated metric system to base it's physics off of, however, our code doesn't really know what a metre is, let alone how say 1 metre should convert into a pixel.

But telling the program that is quite simple- all you have to do is make sure everything works relative to the Box2D units. You could actually just have your sprites overlay the exact position and size directly- however they would take up one small corner of your screen and appear very small. You could also try and make the objects very large, and in very big coordinates, however Box2D struggles with larger entities.

So the idea is just to make a conversion between Box2D and the screen, and it's quite simple:

**Pixel Units**

`const float PIXEL_RATIO = f`

**Box2D Units**

`const float BOX2D_UNIT = 1.0f / PIXEL_RATIO`

In my case, my Pixel Ratio was 15.0f, but this should be adjusted to how large you want objects to appear on your screen relative to what they're set in Box2D.

The conversions can then be done like so:

With size:

**Box2D to Pixel Size**

`x * PIXEL_RATIO`

**Pixel Size to Box2D**

`x * BOX2D_UNIT`

I further developed my inline converter to also convert coordinates:

**Box2D to Pixel Coordinates**

`vector * PIXEL_RATIO`

**Pixel to Box2D Coordinates**

`vector * PIXEL_RATIO`

All of these functions were set up in `inline` functions to make them easy to call during development, as they were essentially required in every instance where Box2D objects were available.
